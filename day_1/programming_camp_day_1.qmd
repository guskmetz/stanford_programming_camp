Introductions

  * Gus - Norman, OK; board games...

Introduce yourselves 

* Name
* Where you're from
* Hobby *or* a book/movie/other thing you did recently 


## Some Advice


Free Disposal 

  * You are at the start of a very formative phase of your life
  * You are here for a marathon not a sprint
  * Your cohort and the other students in the department are your colleagues
  * You are all smart you don't need to prove that to anyone
  * Asking questions is a way to learn not to signal
  * Find some non-econ/non-grad student friends!
  * SF is fun but Stanford's comparative advantage is nature

## Why do we have programming camp? {.smaller}


* Modern economics **requires** more than pen and paper
* Need to be able to communicate with a computer to help you with data/model/simulations
* Many of you already know how to code in some language...but I suspect you learned in an ad hoc way
* Attempt to bring everyone onto even footing so that you can spend the time in first year classes learning the economics not how to code

\pause

* Sessions in **R** and Sessions in **Python**
  * Get you ready for metrics/research going forward
  * Get you ready for dynamic programming in first year Macro
* Very low stakes - you are the best judge of the value of your time

# Intro to R


## Why R as an economist?  {.smaller}

Pros:

  * Free and user driven
  * Widely used in fields outside of economics
  * New ``exotic estimators" and ML methods appear in R first
  * Great for working with messy, complex, and multiple data sets 
  * Low bar to produce beautiful graphics
  * Easy to integrate with Latex and Beamer

Cons:

  * If you have a pristine data set and want to run a few regressions maybe use STATA
  * If you want to use **really big** data


## Other useful resources for learning R

* R for Data Science - Freely available at: [http://r4ds.had.co.nz/](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* *Advanced R* by Hadley Wickham for intermediate programmers
* Data Visualization: A practical introduction - Freely available at [https://socviz.co/](https://socviz.co/)
* Data Camp - free courses for R, python and more


## Plan for first sessions


*  Nuts and Bolts/Grammar of Graphics
*  Importing/Transforming/Tidy Data
*  Relational Data/Regressions/Rmarkdown
*  Control Flow/Functions/Functionals


## Getting started with R (at home)

Installing R (the engine)

* [Download and Install](https://cloud.r-project.org/) 
    * pick the latest version for your OS
    * each year a new version of R is available, and 2-3 minor releases

Installing RStudio (the car)

* [Download and install](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.)
    * scroll down to "Installers for Supported Platforms" near the bottom 
    * pick the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system

Installing Tex
  
* To use Tex for typesetting with RStudio download and install:
  * Windows: [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download)
  * Mac: [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
  * Linux: [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)


## Getting started with R (today)

RStudio is a user-friendly graphical interface for the R software
  
  * Lots of nice built in helpfulness
  * Easy to interface with git

We will use Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud)

  * Cloud version that can be accessed directly from your browser
  * Waste as little time as possible getting things set up
  * Happy to provide support for you setting it up on your own machine
  * Have you all set up your accounts?

## Running R code {.smaller}

Interpreter mode 

  * The console is good for seeing results interactively
  * Try typing: 
  
```{r, eval = F}
print("hello world!")
```
  
  * The console can also work as a calculator
  * R understands some math already
  * You can also run system commands that you would run in your terminal 

Scripting mode

  * To save our work/do more complicated things we use text files called Rscripts
  * Click on File > New File > R Script 

# Nuts and Bolts

## R as a calculator

* R can be used as a calculator
* Intuitive arithmetic operators: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), exponentiation (`^`), modulus (`%%`)
* Built in constants: `pi`, `LETTERS`, `state.abb`, `state.name`, etc.


## Creating new objects

* Variables are objects used to store various information
* In R you do not declare the variable type 
* You can create new objects with `<-` (also `->`)

```{r num_42s}
x <- 42
```

* Combine items using `c()`

```{r list_example}
x <- c(42, 43)
x[1]
```

* All R statements when you create objects have the same form

```{r, eval = F}
object_name <- value
```

* Best practice not to use `=` - reserved for use within functions

## Making your code readable

* Use informative and descriptive object names
* Surround your `<-` with spaces
* In general use spaces to improve readability
* R does not care if you break code across lines

## Naming Objects

* i_use_snake_case
* otherPeopleUseCamelCase
* some.people.use.periods
* And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
* Very helpful to distinguish your objects from built in objects/functions/etc


## Naming Objects

* RStudio is really helpful
* Create an object with the name `really_long_and_painful_to_type` and assign it the value of 42
* To inspect the object start to type "really" and then press TAB
* Oops the value was supposed to be 43...press the up arrow when typing at the command line

## Naming Objects

Make yet another variable

```{r, eval = F}
r_rocks <- 3
```

Let's try to inspect it?

```{r, eval = F}
r_rock
R_rocks
```

Why don't these work?

## Naming Objects

* There's a contract between you and R (and really most programming languages)
* It will do tedious and hard computations for you but in return you must be completely precise in your instructions
* Typos matter
* Case matters
* Indexing matters (R starts with 1)

## Calling functions

* R and all the associated packages have many functions that are all called in a similar manner:

```{r, eval = F}
function_name(argument_1 = value_1, 
              argument_2 = value_2,
              ...,
              argument_n = value_n)
```

* Let's try using `seq()` which makes regular sequences of numbers
* What are the arguments to `seq()`? How could you find out?

## Calling functions

* Create a sequence of even numbers from 1 to 10 and assign it to an object called `even`
* Create a sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 10 in two ways: using `seq()` and using your already created object `even`
* Use `sum()`,  `length()`, and `mean()` to calculate the average value


## Packages

* Packages are a collection of functions, compiled code, and sample data
* They are stored under a directory called library in the R environment
* Some packages are installed by default during R installation and are always automatically loaded at the beginning of an R session
* You can install and load additional packages

## Packages

R comes pre-loaded with a number of packages, appropriately called the base packages. We can see which packages are installed by running the following command:

```{r list_base_packages}
rownames(installed.packages(priority="base"))
```


## Packages

![Installed packages](./figures/rpackages_images.png){width=80%}


## Packages 

```{r, eval = F}
# Install a package on your computer
# (also this is how you write comments in R)
# You only need to run this command once! 
# (...you need to install all packages for every new Posit Cloud Project Work space)
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("AER")

# Load an installed package in the R session
# You need to load the package every time!
library(ggplot2)
library(AER)
```

[Matejka & Fitzmaurice 2017](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)


## Introduction

  * What is a graphic? How can we succinctly describe a graphic? How can we create the graphic we described?
  * A grammar is an abstraction which makes thinking, reasoning, and communicating graphics easier
  * Developed by Lealand Wilkinson (1999/2005) refined and implemented in R by Hadley Wickham (2006)
  * Basic idea: building up a graphic from multiple layers of data

## `ggplot2` packages

* Advantages of `ggplot2`

  * layered grammar of graphics that allows you to specify building blocks of graphics and combine them to create just about any kind of graphical display
  * very flexible can make plots ranging from simple scatter/bar/line to histogram/density/boxplot to maps
  * documentation is well-written and online support is plentiful
  * many packages exist which extend the functionality

\pause

* limitations of `ggplot2`
  
  * does not handle 3D graphics - generally 3d plots do not translate well to 2d presentations
  * does not offer interactive plots
    * use `plotly` instead
  * inefficient for graph/network plots with nodes and edges
    * use `igraph` instead


## A great graph

## Unpacking the aesthetics

| Information | Aesthetic |
|-------------|-----------|
| Size of Napoleon's Grande Armée | Width of path |
| Longitude of the army's position | x-axis |
| Latitude of the army's position | y-axis |
| Direction of the army's movement | Color of path |
| Date of points along retreat path | Text below plot |
| Temperature during the army's retreat | Line below plot |

## How to build a plot

When creating a plot we start with data

* Let's check out the dataset `CigarettesSW`
* This is a built in dataset from the `AER` packages
* Step 1 is to load in the data

```{r load_cigarettes_data}
data("CigarettesSW")
```

We can look at the data using the functions: `head()`, `tail()`, `summary()`, and `help()`
		
		
## How to build a plot
	
**Goal** Simple scatter plot of cigarette taxes (`tax`) vs per capita consumption of cigarettes (`packs`)
\pause

* More precisely we are mapping:

  * \textcolor{orange}{x-position} to cigarette taxes
  * \textcolor{orange}{y-position} to per capita consumption of cigarettes
  * \textcolor{blue}{color} to the year of the observation
  
* x-position, y-position, and color are all examples of *aesthetics*, things we can perceive on the graphic

\pause 

* To create a complete plot we need to combine:
  * the data - represented by the point geom
  * the scales and coordinate system - which generates axes and legends so we can read values from the graph
  * plot annotations - such as the background and plot title

## Actually building the plot

How do we implement this grammar using code?

  * `ggplot()` function initializes a basic graph structure
  * Different parts of a plot can be added together using `+`
  * Any data or arguments you supply to the initializing `ggplot()` function call apply to all additional layers
				
```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(CigarettesSW, aes(x = tax, y = packs, color = year)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
       y = "Per Capita Cigarette Consumption (Packs)",
       color = "Year",
       title = "Excise Taxes and Cigarette Consumption")
```


## Actually building the plot

```{r cigarettes_scatter_tax_packs, eval = T, echo = F}
ggplot(CigarettesSW, aes(x = tax, y = packs, color = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
       y = "Per Capita Cigarette Consumption (Packs)",
       color = "Year",
       title = "Excise Taxes and Cigarette Consumption")
```
	
## Try some things out for yourself

* How would you change the code so that different years are represented by different shapes?
* Try changing the plot so that instead of points each observation is represented by the state abb `geom_text()`
* Install and load the package `ggthemes`
* Try **adding** a theme to your plot such as `theme_stata()`, `theme_economist()`
	
## Discrete vs continuous aesthetics

The nature of the data determines the type of aesthetics and graphics you can use. 

In `ggplot2`, there are two types of aesthetics: discrete and continuous.

* Discrete aesthetics are used to represent categories/classes.
* Continuous aesthetics are used to represent numbers.

Sometimes, the aesthetic is neither perfectly discrete or continuous. You could map a category to color (like retreat status in the Minard plot), but you could also map a number to the color (for instance temperature). This is where your judgement comes in (which matters since we are social scientists).

## Layers

\begin{enumerate}
\item data and aesthetic mapping
\begin{itemize}
  \item data are what turn an abstract graphic into a concrete graphic
  \item along with data we need a specification of which variables are mapped to which aesthetics
  \item redundant mappings are important for making accessible graphics for men (colorblind individuals)
\end{itemize}
\item statistical transformation
\item geometric object (geoms)
\begin{itemize}
\item control the type of plot you create
\item each geom can only display certain aesthetics
\end{itemize}
\item position adjustment
\end{enumerate}

## Layers in the wild

```{r layers_in_wild, eval = F}
ggplot() + 
	geom_histogram(data = CigarettesSW, 
	               aes(x = tax, fill = year),
	               bins = 30, 
	               position = "identity", 
	               alpha = 0.5) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Count(States)",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time")
```

## Using a chart to make a point

How has the distribution of taxes changed over time? 

```{r noeval_make_a_point_plot, eval = F, echo = T}
ggplot() + 
	geom_histogram(data = CigarettesSW, 
	               aes(x = tax, fill = year),
	               bins = 30, 
	               position = "identity", 
	               alpha = 0.5) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Count(States)",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time")
```


## Using a chart to make a point

How has the distribution of taxes changed over time? 

```{r make_a_point_plot, echo=F, eval=T}
ggplot() + 
	geom_histogram(data = CigarettesSW, 
	               aes(x = tax, fill = year),
	               bins = 30, 
	               position = "identity", 
	               alpha = 0.5) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Count(States)",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time")
```


## Using a chart to make a point

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(CigarettesSW, aes(x = tax, fill = year)) + 
	geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 2) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Relative Density",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time")
```


## Using a chart to make a point

* What chart you use/how much of the data you show depends on what point you are trying to make 
* Can use different graphics to make your messaging more "crisp"

```{r crisper_plot, echo = F}
ggplot(CigarettesSW, aes(x = tax, fill = year)) + 
	geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 2) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Relative Density",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time")
```


## Scales

* A scale controls the mapping from data to aesthetic attributes 
* Need one scale for each aesthetic property used in a layer
* Scales are common across layers to ensure a consistent mapping
* Scales typically map from a single variable to a single aesthetic with some exceptions


## Scales in the wild

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(CigarettesSW, aes(x = tax, fill = year)) + 
	geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 2) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Count(States)",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time") +
  scale_x_log10()
```


## Scales in the wild

```{r cigarettes_tax_density_log10, echo = F}
ggplot(CigarettesSW, aes(x = tax, fill = year)) + 
	geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 2) +
	labs(x = "Average Excise Tax",
	     y = "Count(States)",
	     fill = "Year",
	     title = "Distribution of Excise Taxes over Time") +
  scale_x_log10()
```


## More plots

* Load in the `BankWages` dataset `data(BankWages)`
* What are the variables? hint(`head()`, `summary()`, `help()`)
* Let's make a bar plot of the gender distribution by job
  * What do we want our plot to look like?
  * What aesthetics should we use? What variables to map to each aesthetic?


## Bar plots

```{r, eval = F}
data(BankWages)

ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender")
```


## Bar plots

```{r bankwages_job_gender_count, echo = F}
data(BankWages)

ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender")
```



## Bar plots

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender")
```



## Bar plots

```{r bankwages_job_gender_share, echo = F}
ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender")
```


## Faceting

* We can show more of the data using faceting
* Faceting is a way to produce multiple charts showing different subset of the data
* Splits the data by different variable(s) values
* We can change the scales to retail comparisons across facets or apply the scales only locally

## Faceting

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender") +
  facet_wrap("minority")
```
## Faceting

```{r bankwages_job_gender_by_minority, echo = F}
ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender") +
  facet_wrap("minority")
```

## Saving a chart

* Whenever possible use a vectorized format (pdf, eps, etc)

```{r, eval = F}
p_job_gender <-
  ggplot(BankWages, aes(x = job, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Job",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender") 

p_job_gender

ggsave(p_job_gender, filename = "job_gender.pdf", 
       width = 6.5, height = 3, units = "in")
```


## Review

The layered grammar defines the following components of a graphic:
  
  * a default dataset and set of mappings from variables to aesthetics
  * one or more layers, with each layer having one geometric object, one statistical transformations, one position adjustment, and optionally one dataset and set of aesthetic mappings
  * one scale for each aesthetic mapping used
  * a coordinate system
  * the facet specification 

## Review

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```
